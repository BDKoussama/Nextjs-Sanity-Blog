                Hello i&apos;m Peter  a father of two kids ( jacob and nina ). 
                I created this blog to provide information and advices on choosing the right car seat for infants, 
                as well as tips on using and caring for car seats. 
                my knowledge and expertise on the topic likely comes from my own experiences as a parent of young children. 
                I have done extensive research on car seat safety and regulations to provide accurate and helpful information to My readers. In addition to running this blog, I&apos;am also a busy parent who spends a lot of time taking care of his children and managing his household.
